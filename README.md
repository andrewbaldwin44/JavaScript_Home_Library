# Your Home Library

Create a web page to display your homeLibrary object.

## Goal

Someone viewing your page should

- see all of the books in your library.
- see the book that you are currently reading.
- see that last book you finished reading, and the date

It would definitely be a good idea to modify Book to also have an imgUrl property where you can reference an image from the web. (You could also save the image into the project in an `assets` folder.)

## Setup

- Create the required files.
  - `index.html`
  - `app.js`
  - `styles.css`

## Challenge

Create a form to add books directly from the web page.

When you submit a book, it should be added to the books array in your homeLibrary object.
